__brute__ is a Python-based library framework and engine that enables security professionals to rapidly construct bruteforce / credential stuffing attacks. It features both a multi-purpose command-line application (`brute`), and a software library that can be used in tandem to quickly generate standalone module scripts for attack.

This is `brute`'s registry for installable modules. You can check out the project on Github [here](https://github.com/ex0dus-0x/brute).

This is largely inspired by the design implemented for [sn0int's registry](https://sn0int.com/).

| Module Name          | Description       | Installation                   |
|:---------------------|:------------------|:-------------------------------|
| __name/name__        | Example Module    | `brute pull name/name`         |
